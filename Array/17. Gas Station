//AKA Circular tour

You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs cost[i] of gas to travel from the ith station to its next (i + 1)th station.
ou begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations.

//Idea:
- If we encounter -ve distance i.e gas[i] - cost[i] -> store them in another variable, prev
- If we encounter +ve distance -> store them in another variable, cur
- to complete the circuit, cur + prev //aka cur - (-prev) >= 0

int canCompleteCircuit(vector<int>& gas, vector<int>& cost) {
        int cur =0;
        int prev = 0;
        int start = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i<gas.size(); i++){
            cur += gas[i]-cost[i];
            while(cur<0){   //if the distance travelled is -ve, we know that any gas station before i is not an answer
                start = i+1;  //we start from next 
                prev += cur;  //this is important, if we encounter another -ve distance, 
                cur = 0;
            }
        } 
        return((cur + prev)>=0?start : -1);   //cur+prev = total distance of a circular path
        
    }
