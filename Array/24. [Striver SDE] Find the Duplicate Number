Given an array of integers nums containing n + 1 integers where each integer is in the range [1, n] inclusive.
There is only one repeated number in nums, return this repeated number.
You must solve the problem without modifying the array nums and uses only constant extra space.

//Idea:
- Concept of slow and fast pointer used in linked list to find loop

//Why it works is tricky so understand it well from here  https://youtu.be/32Ll35mhWg0?list=PLgUwDviBIf0rPG3Ictpu74YWBQ1CaBkm2&t=317


int findDuplicate(vector<int>& nums) {
        int slow = nums[0];
        int fast = nums[0];
        
        do{
            slow = nums[slow];
            fast = nums[nums[fast]];
        }
        while(slow!=fast);
        
        fast = nums[0];
        
        while(slow != fast){
            slow = nums[slow];
            fast = nums[fast];
        }
        return slow;
            
    
    }
