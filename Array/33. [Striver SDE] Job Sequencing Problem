Given a set of N jobs where each jobi has a deadline and profit associated with it.

Each job takes 1 unit of time to complete and only one job can be scheduled at a time. 
We earn the profit associated with job if and only if the job is completed by its deadline.

Find the number of jobs done and the maximum profit.

Note: Jobs will be given in the form (Jobid, Deadline, Profit) associated with that Job.


static bool cmp(Job &a, Job &b){
    return a.profit>b.profit;
}
    
vector<int> JobScheduling(Job arr[], int n) 
{ 
  sort(arr, arr+n, cmp);

  int maxdead = -1;
  for(int i = 0; i<n; i++){
      maxdead = max(maxdead, arr[i].dead);
  }

  vector<int>jobsDone(maxdead+1,-1);
  int countJobs = 0;
  int totalProfit = 0;

  for(int i = 0; i<n; i++){
      for(int j = arr[i].dead; j>0; j--){
          if(jobsDone[j]== -1){
              countJobs++;
              totalProfit += arr[i].profit;
              jobsDone[j] = i;
              break;
          }
      }
  }

  vector<int>res;
  res.push_back(countJobs);
  res.push_back(totalProfit);
  return res;
}
