Dora, the explorer, visits India and decides to try the famous Indian food. 
However, the restaurant accepts only Indian currency i.e. [1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 500, 1000] valued coins.
So, Dora goes to a bank that has an infinite supply of each of the denominations to make a change for a given ‘Amount’ of money. 
As a cashier at the bank, your task is to provide Dora the minimum number of coins that add up to the given ‘Amount’.

//There is a DP variant of this problem on leetcode, check that out

int findMinimumCoins(int amount) 
{   int coins[] = {1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 500, 1000};
    int ans = 0;
    if(amount == 0) return ans;
    int i = 8;
    while(amount && i>=0){
        if(coins[i]<=amount && amount - coins[i]>=0){
            ans++;
            amount = amount - coins[i];
        }
        else{
            i--;
        }
    }
    return ans>0 && !amount ? ans : -1;
}
