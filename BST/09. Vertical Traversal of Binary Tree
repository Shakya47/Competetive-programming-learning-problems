Given a Binary Tree, find the vertical traversal of it starting from the leftmost level to the rightmost level.
If there are multiple nodes passing through a vertical line, then they should be printed as they appear in level order traversal of the tree.

//Idea:
- Same as vertical traversal in binary tree
- Use BFS as the problem said to have level order traversal for multiple nodes on the same vertical line
- for BFS we use a queue, in this queue there will be pair of Node & height
- maintain a map[height][root->data]
- for root->left, height -= 1, for root->right, height += 1

vector<int> verticalOrder(Node *root)
    {
        map<int,vector<int>>mp;
        vector<int> res;
        queue<pair<Node*, int>> q;
        q.push(make_pair(root, 0));
        while(q.empty()==false){
            auto it = q.front();
            q.pop();
            Node* cur = it.first;
            int hd = it.second;
            mp[hd].push_back(cur->data);
            if(cur->left!=NULL) q.push(make_pair(cur->left, hd-1));
            if(cur->right!=NULL) q.push(make_pair(cur->right, hd+1));
        }
        for(auto p: mp){
            for(auto it:p.second){
                res.push_back(it);
            }
        }

        return res;
    }
