Ninja is given a binary search tree and an integer. Now he is given a particular key in the tree and returns its ceil value. Can you help Ninja solve the problem?
Ceil of an integer is the closest integer greater than or equal to a given number.

int findCeil(BinaryTreeNode<int> *root, int x){
    int ceilVal = -1;   //corner case, not node is equal or greater to x
    while(root != NULL){
        if(root->data == x) return ceilVal = root->data;
        if(root->data > x){
            ceilVal = root->data;
            root = root->left;
        }
        else root = root->right;
    }
    return ceilVal;
}
