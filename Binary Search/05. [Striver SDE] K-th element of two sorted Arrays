Given two sorted arrays arr1 and arr2 of size N and M respectively and an element K. 
The task is to find the element that would be at the k’th position of the final sorted array.

//Idea is based on the previous problem

int kthElement(int arr1[], int arr2[], int n, int m, int k)
{
    if(m<n) return kthElement( arr2,  arr1,   m,  n,  k);

    int low = max(0,k-m), high = min(k,n);

    while(low<=high){
        int cut1 = (low + high)/2;
        int cut2 = k - cut1;

        int left1 = (cut1 == 0 ? INT_MIN : arr1[cut1 - 1]);
        int left2 = (cut2 == 0 ? INT_MIN : arr2[cut2 - 1]);
        int right1 = (cut1 == n ? INT_MAX : arr1[cut1]);
        int right2 = (cut2 == m ? INT_MAX : arr2[cut2]);

        if(left1 <= right2 && left2 <= right1) return max(left1, left2);
        else if(left1 > right2) high = cut1 - 1;
        else low = cut1 + 1;
    }
    return 1;
}
