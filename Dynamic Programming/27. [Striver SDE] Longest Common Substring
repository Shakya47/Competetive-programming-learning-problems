You have been given two strings 'STR1' and 'STR2'. You have to find the length of the longest common substring.
A string “s1” is a substring of another string “s2” if “s2” contains the same characters as in “s1”, in the same order and in continuous fashion also.

//Idea:
- almost same as longest common subsequence

int lcs(string &text1, string &text2){
	int n1 = text1.length();
    int n2 = text2.length();
    vector<vector<int>>dp(n1+1, vector<int>(n2+1, 0));
    int ans = 0;
    for(int ind1 = 1; ind1 <= n1; ind1++)
        for(int ind2 = 1; ind2 <= n2; ind2++){
            if(text1[ind1-1] == text2[ind2-1]) {
                dp[ind1][ind2] = 1 + dp[ind1-1][ind2-1];
                ans = max(dp[ind1][ind2], ans);
            }
            else
                dp[ind1][ind2] = 0;
        }

    return ans;
}
