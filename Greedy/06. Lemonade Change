At a lemonade stand, each lemonade costs $5. Customers are standing in a queue to buy from you and order one at a time (in the order specified by bills). 
Each customer will only buy one lemonade and pay with either a $5, $10, or $20 bill. 
You must provide the correct change to each customer so that the net transaction is that the customer pays $5.

Note that you do not have any change in hand at first.

Given an integer array bills where bills[i] is the bill the ith customer pays, 
return true if you can provide every customer with the correct change, or false otherwise.

//Idea:
- Think of yourself as a cashier, have the counts of each denominations
- in our problem, $20 is not required

var lemonadeChange = function(bills) {
    let five = 0, ten = 0;
    for(let i = 0; i < bills.length; i++) {
        if(bills[i] === 5) {
            five++;
        } else if (bills[i] === 10) {
            if(five) {
                five--;
                ten++;
            } else {
                return false;
            }
        } else {
            if(five && ten) {
                five--;
                ten--;
            } else if (five >= 3) {
                five = five - 3;
            } else {
                return false;
            }
        }
    }
    return true;
};
