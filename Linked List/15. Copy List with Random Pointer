A linked list of length n is given such that each node contains an additional random pointer, which could point to any node in the list, or null.



Node* copyRandomList(Node* head) {
        if(head==NULL) return head;
        Node *curr = head;
        Node *next = head;
        while(curr!=NULL){      //Step 1: Create same val nodes adjacent to the existing node
            next = curr->next;
            curr->next = new Node(curr->val);
            curr->next->next = next;
            curr = next;
        }
        
        for(curr = head; curr!= NULL; curr = curr->next->next)      //Step 2: assign random to the adjacent nodes
            curr->next->random = (curr->random!=NULL)?curr->random->next:NULL;
        
        curr = head;
        Node *copy = head->next;
        Node *deepCopy = copy;
        while(curr->next!=NULL && copy->next!=NULL){    //Step 3: De-link both the linked list
            curr->next = copy->next;
            curr = curr->next;
            copy->next = curr->next;
            copy = copy->next;
        }
        curr->next = NULL;
        copy->next = NULL;
        return deepCopy;
        
    }
