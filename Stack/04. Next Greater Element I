//The next greater element of some element x in an array is the first greater element that is to the right of x in the same array.
//You are given two distinct 0-indexed integer arrays nums1 and nums2, where nums1 is a subset of nums2.
//With example is would be simple

Input: nums1 = [4,1,2], nums2 = [1,3,4,2]
Output: [-1,3,-1]
Explanation: The next greater element for each value of nums1 is as follows:
- 4 is underlined in nums2 = [1,3,4,2]. There is no next greater element, so the answer is -1.
- 1 is underlined in nums2 = [1,3,4,2]. The next greater element is 3.
- 2 is underlined in nums2 = [1,3,4,2]. There is no next greater element, so the answer is -1.

//Its same like reverse stock span just the difference is here there are 2 arrays, nums1 = subset(nums2);
So we will create hashmap with the next greatest element in it.

 vector<int> nextGreaterElement(vector<int>& nums1, vector<int>& nums2) {
        int n = nums1.size();
        int m = nums2.size();
        stack<int> s;
        vector<int> res(n);
        unordered_map<int, int> mp;
        s.push(nums2[m-1]);
        mp[nums2[m-1]]=-1;
        
        for(int i = m-2; i>=0; i--){
                while(s.empty()==false && s.top()<=nums2[i])
                    s.pop();
                mp[nums2[i]] = s.empty()?-1:s.top();
                s.push(nums2[i]);
        }
        
        for(int i = 0; i<n; i++){
            res[i] = mp[nums1[i]];
        }
        return res;     
    }
