Given an array of integers temperatures represents the daily temperatures, 
return an array answer such that answer[i] is the number of days you have to wait after the ith day to get a warmer temperature. 
If there is no future day for which this is possible, keep answer[i] == 0 instead.

//Hint
- Same as Next Greater Element 1
- But in this store the index to find the gap between current and next greater element

Example 1:

Input: temperatures = [73,74,75,71,69,72,76,73]
Output: [1,1,4,2,1,1,0,0]
Example 2:

Input: temperatures = [30,40,50,60]
Output: [1,1,1,0]



var dailyTemperatures = function(temperatures) {
    let n = temperatures.length;
    let stack = [];
    let res = new Array(n).fill(n);

    for (let i = n-1; i >= 0; i--) {
        while(stack.length && temperatures[i] >= temperatures[stack[stack.length - 1]]) {
            stack.pop();
        }
        res[i] = stack.length ? stack[stack.length - 1] - i : 0;
        stack.push(i);
    }

    return res;
};
