Given the root of a binary tree, flatten the tree into a "linked list":
  The "linked list" should use the same TreeNode class where the right child pointer points to the next node in the list and the left child pointer is always null.
  The "linked list" should be in the same order as a pre-order traversal of the binary tree.
  
//Here its given Pre-order traversal -> root left right
//But we have to do reverse of post order -> root right left  so that we can make all the nodes point to right & left to null

class Solution {
    TreeNode* prev = NULL;
    
public:
    void flatten(TreeNode* root) {
        if(root==NULL) return;
        TreeNode *node = root;
        flatten(node->right);
        flatten(node->left);
        node->right = prev;
        node->left = NULL;
        prev = node;
    }
};

-----------------------------------------------
JavaScript:
- Have to put prev in the function because for each testcase we want to reset the prev value

var flatten = function(root) {
  let prev = null;  

  function dfs(node) {
    if (!node) return;
    dfs(node.right);
    dfs(node.left);
    node.right = prev;
    node.left = null;
    prev = node;
  }

  dfs(root);
};
